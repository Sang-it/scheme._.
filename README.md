# Scheme Implementation in Haskell

Just learning Haskell.

Prerequisites:

> GHC
> Cabal

How to Run:

```
cabal run [filename]
```
This will take a filename as argument and interpret it.

```
cabal run
```
Using cabal run with no arguments will just run the REPL.

Or
```
cabal build
```
And just use the executable.
